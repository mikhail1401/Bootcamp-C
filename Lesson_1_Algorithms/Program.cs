1. Константные (Constant): Algorithms that take the same amount of time regardless of the size of the input. In Big O notation, these are denoted as O(1).
2. Логарифмические (Logarithmic): Algorithms whose time complexity grows logarithmically with the size of the input. Examples include binary search. Denoted as O(log n).
3. Линейные (Linear): Algorithms where the time taken increases linearly with the size of the input. Denoted as O(n).
4. Линейно-логарифмические (Linearithmic): Algorithms with time complexity that is a combination of linear and logarithmic growth. Denoted as O(n log n).
5. Квадратные (Quadratic): Algorithms whose time complexity grows quadratically with the size of the input. Examples include nested loops where each loop iterates over the size of the input. Denoted as O(n^2).
6. Кубические (Cubic): Algorithms with time complexity that grows cubically with the size of the input. Denoted as O(n^3).
